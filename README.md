## The app

This front-end app allows the user to create quizzes using flashcards and categorizing them by topics.

* The user can create topics (eg. math, science). 
* You can then create quizzes linked to these topics such as chemistry, biology linked with the science topic.
* Each quiz can have a number of 'flashcards' created for it, which have two 'sides'. One side could be a question or prompt and when clicked the other side will render, displaying an answer.
